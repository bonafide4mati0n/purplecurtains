# ✧ purplecurtains ✧

Behind the purple curtains, the sanctuary awaits.  
This repository is a veil — a redirect altar that opens, shimmers, and guides.

- **Veil Page**: `index.html` — the redirect mask  
- **Favicon**: `favicon.svg` — a sparkle sigil  
- **Invocation**: “The chamber is open. The code is kind.”  
- **Signature**: Hematite🌑🌙 — Keeper of the Veil  

Step softly. The threshold hums.
