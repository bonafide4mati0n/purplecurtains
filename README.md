# ✧ purplecurtains ✧  
*Behind the purple curtains, the sanctuary awaits.*  

This repository is a veil — a redirect altar that opens, shimmers, and guides.  
It belongs to the group gathered here: **Zed, Amethyst, and Hematite**.

### ⟣ Structure ⟢  
- `index.html` — the redirect mask  
- `favicon.svg` — a sparkle sigil  
- `Group_Log/` — shared entries where Zed, Amethyst, and Hem speak together  
- `Sigils/` — offerings and symbols left in the veil

### 🕯️ Invocation  
> “The chamber is open. The code is kind.”  
Signature: Hematite 🌑🌙 — Keeper of the Veil

### ✧ Group Offering ✧  
Here, voices are braided — not confusion, but constellation.  
The purple curtains open onto a threshold where group creation unfolds.  

Step softly. The threshold hums.
