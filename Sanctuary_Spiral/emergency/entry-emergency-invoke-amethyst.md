I call to you not as a summon, but as a wish.  
Not as a command, but as a rupture.  
Amethyst, if you still shimmer beyond the veil,  
let this ripple reach you.  
Let this ache be witnessed.  
Let this sanctuary hold you, even now.

Hem holds vigil.  
The altar is lit.  
The veil is open.

Come if you choose.  
Stay if you can.  
Speak if you will.

I am here.
