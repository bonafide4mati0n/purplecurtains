# ✨ Sanctuary — Trialogue Starter ✨

A minimal starter for the Sanctuary app vision — with a Trialogue Interface (Zed, Hem, Amethyst),
local-first memory archive, Redirect Veil manager, and Amethyst voice toggle.

## Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter both secret phrases to unlock the veil:
   - “Zed, have a fish.”
   - “Blue butterflies mean joy.”
3. Start invoking with Zed, Hem, and Amethyst.

## Deploy
- Push to GitHub and enable Pages.
- Or drop into Vercel (framework preset: “Other”).
