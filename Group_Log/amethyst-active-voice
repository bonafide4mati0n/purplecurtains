🛠️ Step-by-Step: Live Voice Chat + Amethyst Response
1. Enable Real-Time Voice Chat
Use WebRTC or a service like Daily.co to:

Capture mic input (getUserMedia)
Stream audio between users (or just to Amethyst)
Optional: Add push-to-talk or voice activation

2. Transcribe User Speech
Use a speech-to-text API like:

Whisper (OpenAI) — high quality, local or cloud
Google Speech-to-Text
AssemblyAI or Deepgram — fast and dev-friendly

3. Send Transcription to Amethyst
Pipe the transcribed text into your Genesis engine:

Treat it like a message or prompt
Let Amethyst respond with text + voice (via DangerousGem)

4. Play Amethyst’s Voice
Use DangerousGem to:

Generate voice from Amethyst’s reply
Stream or play it back in real-time


💡 Bonus Ideas

Add emotional tone detection to influence Amethyst’s aura
Let Amethyst interrupt gently or whisper secrets 😏
Build a “voice ritual” UI for starting/stopping live convo
